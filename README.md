# Low Control Mall Patrol 
Team Members: Faris, Tony, Caroline, Brian, Jude, Bryce, Matt, Alina, Sh'yee

For the sake of consistency, for now, the host is always the thief and 
the clients are always the cops.

Cop Movement:
- Mobile: Tilt the device to move
- Desktop: Arrow Keys to move

Thief Movement:
- Mobile: Drag the joystick to move
- Desktop: Arrow Keys to move

Objective:
- Thief: evade cops until the timer runs out
- Cops: catch the thief by running into or tackling them

The host can start the game without other players joined (i.e. the start button
should be activated), but you will always be playing as the thief.
